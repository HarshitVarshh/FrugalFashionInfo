        The fashion sector is well-known for its capacity to establish trends that have the ability to influence society and the purchasing behaviors of a broad range of consumers. 
        However, the influence that regular customers have on the sector is sometimes overlooked. 
        In general, clothing has become more disposable, more of a commodity than something to treasure due to the surprisingly quick rate at which it is now made, worn, 
        and thrown away, and consumers have been trained to expect a steady supply of new goods which creates pollution and landfill. 
        There are so many ways to make sustainable fashion by using the concept frugal innovation.
